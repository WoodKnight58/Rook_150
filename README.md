# Rook 150

This is version 5 and I'm planning on printing it: (still not fully tested)

Changes from Original Rook:
  1. Linear rod only (x, y , and z)
  2. 150mm x 150mm build plate
  3. Reprap- it could replicate it's own printed parts
  4. Motors have wedges to help tension
  5. V6 hotend with 40mm x 40mm heatsink fan
  6. Bottom z limit switch has mount built into base
  7. All rods are held in plase with bolts that clamp down on them
  8. Feet are part of the base

Wanted to get my idea into CAD and add to this great community.

Integrated linear rods into motion system to replace linear rails.

Increased build area to 150mm

V2 combines the front of the upper frame with the idlers and the rear of the upper frame with the motor mounts.

V4 is cut into pieces so that it can be printed on itself
